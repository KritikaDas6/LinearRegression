Predicting Market Returns Using Machine Learning through Linear Regression

Abstract 
Many investors practice financial decisions by factoring in sentiment analysis, public policy, corporate news, etc. 
This paper researches whether financial market returns can be predicted only through quantitative data using a time-series
linear regression without considering in these factors. Three case studies are featured: S&P 500, Johnson and Johnson, and Bitcoin. 
The research discovered that a linear model cannot be generalized to predict returns for all financial markets; however, it can be significant
to specific sectors. It suggests that to predict returns for all financial markets, factors that investors practice should be considered
in creating a machine learning model.
